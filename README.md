Database_Systems_implementation
=======================
The course will cover database system internals such as access structures and indexing,
query evaluation, query optimization, recovery, and concurrency control in traditional 
database systems. We will not have time to cover object-oriented and object-relational
database systems, even though they are listed in the catalog description. 

By the time you are through with the class, you will have a very good idea how real-life, 
industrial-strength database systems such as Oracle, DB2, and SQL Server function. The 
course will be organized around a substantial software development project that will count
for most of the final class grade. 

In this project, the goal will be to design and implementa single-user database management
system that supports a subset of SQL and some basic relational algebra operations (select, 
project, and join).
